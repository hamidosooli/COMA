RuntimeError: one of the variables needed for gradient computation has been modified by an inplace operation: [MPSFloatType [125, 128]] is at version 2; expected version 1 instead. Hint: enable anomaly detection to find the operation that failed to compute its gradient, with torch.autograd.set_detect_anomaly(True).
